# Digital Library
Digital Library is the name given to the resource containing all the elements of digital design, their explanations, and examples. From the smallest building block, to complete page templates, you will be able to construct a digital asset from these items, safe in the knowledge you’re being consistent across the business.

We have documented our [atoms](atoms) and [molecules](molecules) and will work with other teams to build these out into organisms, pages and templates as the project evolves and as business requirements dictate.

## Three’s Digital Library is
- in conformance with the principles of Atomic design: http://patternlab.io/about.html.
- the “Look and feel” of Three’s digital presences
- the layout, fonts, colours and graphics of Three’s digital presences
- a“front-end”, “client-side” framework
- a CSS framework and a set of HTML markup patterns
- visual design components and patterns
- a visual language for Three’s digital presences
- web content management / operating system agnostic.

## Three’s Digital Library is not
- a “styleguide” or “pattern library” - both have specific connotations and pre-formed      rules on how they work and are used.
- a Content Management System (CMS) – for example Hybris, Fatwire etc
- a server-side development framework
- a programming language
- the Online team or the Design team.

## Consistent user experience
Digital development at Three happens across a number of Online teams, within numerous external agency partners and within other areas of the organisation but until now there has been no effective way to help everybody use the same user interface elements. 
There have been plenty of attempts at documenting standards and procedures yet still the Three website is difficult to navigate and inconsistent in its interaction design. There are so many different solutions to the same problem that our visitors have to re-learn different interfaces as they move throughout three.co.uk and then again in store.three.co.uk and My3.

## Collaborative problem solving
The Three Digital Library aims to be a regularly released collaborative effort, facilitated by Team Babbage in Online. Everybody can submit problems and solutions to everyday web design issues. The Digital Library will grow with the demands of the evolving web and help us be more productive, reduce duplication of effort and make it much easier to commission work form external suppliers.
